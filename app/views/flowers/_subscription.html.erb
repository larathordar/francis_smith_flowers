We wholeheartedly believe that receiving a weekly bunch of beautiful fresh f
lowers is life enhancing and a wonderful way to bring nature into our lives &
homes and should be one of the weekly rituals to make us all feel better.

Each week our gorgeous seasonal blooms will not only look stunning but will
feature flowers aligning to our monthly affirmations blog, which goes deeper
into the symbolism & healing properties of the flowers we love so much.  </p>
